## 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `VDDForecast_2025` (or any name you prefer)
   - Make it **Public** (required for free Streamlit Cloud)
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have files)
   - Click **"Create repository"**

2. **Push your code from your local computer**:

Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Create .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files
echo "secrets.toml" > .gitignore
echo "data.xlsx" >> .gitignore
echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pyc" >> .gitignore

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - VDD Sales Dashboard"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VDDForecast_2025.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username!

### Step 2: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**: https://share.streamlit.io/

2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account

3. **Click "New app"** button

4. **Fill in the deployment form**:
   - **Repository**: Select `YOUR_USERNAME/VDDForecast_2025`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `dashboard.py`
   - **App URL** (optional): Choose a custom URL like `vdd-sales-dashboard`

5. **Click "Deploy"**

The deployment will start! This takes 2-5 minutes.

### Step 3: Configure Secrets (Google Sheets Credentials)

If you're using Google Sheets:

1. While the app is deploying, click on **"Advanced settings"** or **"⚙️ Settings"**
2. Click on **"Secrets"** tab
3. **Paste your credentials** in TOML format:

```toml
# Google Sheets Configuration
[gsheet]
spreadsheet_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID/edit"

# Paste the contents from your JSON key file here
[gcp_service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "your-project-id"
private_key_id = "your-private-key-id"
private_key = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
client_email = "vdd-dashboard-reader@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
client_id = "123456789"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account%40your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

4. **Click "Save"**

5. The app will automatically restart with the new secrets

### Step 4: Access Your Dashboard

1. Once deployment completes, you'll get a URL like:
   ```
   https://vdd-sales-dashboard.streamlit.app
   ```

2. **Share this URL** with your team!

3. **Bookmark it** for easy access

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- ✅ Keep your `secrets.toml` file LOCAL only
- ✅ Add `secrets.toml` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use read-only (Viewer) permissions for service account
- ✅ Never share your JSON credentials publicly

### ❌ DON'T:
- ❌ Don't commit secrets to GitHub
- ❌ Don't share your service account key
- ❌ Don't give Editor/Owner permissions unnecessarily

---

## 🎨 Customizing Your Deployment

### Custom Domain (Advanced)

Streamlit Cloud doesn't support custom domains on free tier, but you can:
- Use the provided `.streamlit.app` subdomain
- Upgrade to Streamlit Teams for custom domains

### Password Protection (Advanced)

Add basic authentication:

1. Install `streamlit-authenticator`:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit-authenticator
   ```

2. Add to `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   streamlit-authenticator
   ```

3. Add authentication code to your dashboard (see Streamlit docs)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Deploy

**Check:**
- Is `requirements.txt` present and correct?
- Are all dependencies spelled correctly?
- Is `dashboard.py` in the root folder?
- Did you push all files to GitHub?

### "Module not found" Error

- Add the missing module to `requirements.txt`
- Push changes to GitHub
- Streamlit will auto-redeploy

### Google Sheets Not Working

- Check secrets are configured correctly
- Verify service account has access to the sheet
- See [GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md)

### Dashboard is Slow

- Check data size (free tier has 1GB RAM limit)
- Reduce cache TTL (time to live)
- Consider filtering large datasets

### App Shows "Error" or Won't Load

1. Click on **"Manage app"** in Streamlit Cloud
2. Check **"Logs"** tab for errors
3. Look for specific error messages
4. Fix the issue locally and push to GitHub
