# VDD Sales Analysis System - Technical Documentation

## Critical: Two-DataFrame Approach

### Why Two DataFrames?

Your business has **combo items** that contain multiple components. For accurate analysis, we need TWO different views of the data:

---

## DataFrame 1: `df_revenue` (As-Sold)

**Purpose:** Revenue, pricing, and basket analysis

**What it shows:** Items as they were sold to customers

**Example:**
```
Customer purchases "Chicken KFC + Chicken Wonton + Chicken Shaphaley" combo for ₹250

In df_revenue:
- 1 row
- Item: "Chicken KFC + Chicken Wonton + Chicken Shaphaley"
- Revenue: ₹250
- Qty: 1
```

**Used in Tabs:**
- Tab 1: Overview (revenue metrics)
- Tab 2: Top Products (revenue rankings)
- Tab 3: Time Analysis (revenue trends)
- Tab 4: Net Revenue & Discounts
- Tab 5: Basket Analysis (what customers buy together)
- Tab 6: Revenue Forecast

---

## DataFrame 2: `df_quantity` (Component-Level)

**Purpose:** Inventory planning, ingredient procurement, production planning

**What it shows:** Actual items that need to be prepared/stocked

**Example:**
```
Customer purchases "Chicken KFC + Chicken Wonton + Chicken Shaphaley" combo

In df_quantity (EXPLODED):
- 3 rows
- Row 1: Chicken KFC Momo, Qty: 1
- Row 2: Chicken Wonton, Qty: 1
- Row 3: Chicken Shaphaley, Qty: 1
```

**Used in Tabs:**
- Tab 7: Weekly Unit Forecast
- Tab 8: Send Targets

## How the System Handles This

### Data Loading (Automatic):

```python
# Step 1: Load combo reference
combo_items = comboRef['Item Name'].unique()  # 18 combos

# Step 2: Separate combo and non-combo sales
non_combo_sales = sales[NOT in combo_items]  # Standalone items
combo_sales = sales[IN combo_items]          # Combo packages

# Step 3: Explode combo sales
For each combo sale:
    "Chicken KFC + Wonton + Shaphaley" (Qty: 1)
    becomes:
    - Chicken KFC Momo (Qty: 1)
    - Chicken Wonton (Qty: 1)
    - Chicken Shaphaley (Qty: 1)

# Step 4: Combine
df_quantity = non_combo_sales + exploded_combo_sales
```

### Result:

**Chicken Wonton Total Units:**
- Standalone sales: 706 transactions
- From combo sales: ~200 additional units
- **Total in df_quantity: ~900 units** ✓

**Veg Cigar Roll Total Units:**
- Standalone sales: ~500 units
- From 4 different combos: ~800 additional units
- **Total in df_quantity: ~1,300 units** ✓
